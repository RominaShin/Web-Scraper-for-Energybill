# Web-Scraper-for-Energybill
This is  my first attempt of data gatehring by web scraping and Of course it's very inefficient.
<br>
It scrapes all pages of energy bill website and creates a csv and excel file from tables inside.
<br>
As a future work, handle it with Scrapy and python requests. write all tables in one excel file. save datas in database directly.
